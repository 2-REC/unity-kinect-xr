        => Infos related to head tracking (as orientation using gyroscope is not reliable)

        => Links... (check all and see what to keep)

# DOCS
- [ ] KINECT_AR.pptx

    - [ ] Check validity of everything (after tests and evolution)
    - [ ] Replace images taken from Internet where possible
